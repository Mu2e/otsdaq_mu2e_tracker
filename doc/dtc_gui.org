parameters:
  - config_name: points to the configuration file. It is either a directory name or a file name, see below.
  - locating configuration file: 
    - it is assumed that config_name is a located under [[file:../config][otsdaq-mu2e-tracker/config]]
    - if a file='otsdaq-mu2e-tracker/config/config_name.C' exists, the configuration is taken from there
    - if a directory='config/config_name' exists, the configuration is taken from config/config_name/

- to turn ON validation:
#+begin_src
 x->fValidate=1                 // default:1
#+end_src

- to change the reader printout level:
#+begin_src
 x->fReaderTC.fPrintLevel=1     // default:2
#+end_src

- this can also be done in teh configuration file
* CFO panel                                                                  
** status       : prints the CFO status
** writeR       : writes to the CFO register
** readR        : reads from the CFO register
** soft reset   : soft reset of the CFO
** hard reset   : hard reset of the CFO
** launch       : launch external CFO run plan
** EnableBmOff  : enable  'Beam Off' mode - (start the run)
** DisableBmOff : disable 'Beam Off' mode - (stop  the run)                  
- assume that the Bean On mode is disabled
- then, <disable BeamOf> + <soft reset> + <Enable Beam Off> restarts executaion of the current run plan
** Extrnl CT - <External CFO Thread> - obsolete                              
- a run plan can be started just once, no need to have a thread for that
** DTC mask     : defines the number of DTCs in each time chain              
- CFO supports 8 time chains 
- each hex digit of the DTC mask contains the number of DTC's in the corresponding time chain:
#+begin_src 
  ndtcs[i] = (DtcMask >> 4*i) & 0xf
#end_src
** init readout : reads the run plan and initializes the CFO                 
- that includes setting the DTC mask                                  
- currently, it is assumed that the run plans are located in $HOME/test_stand/cfo_run_plans directory
- the directory name will be soon moved to .rootrc
* DTC panel                                                                  
** status       : print the DTC status (several registers)
** writeR       : write the DTC register
** readR        : read  the DTC register
** soft reset   : soft reset of the DTC
** hard reset   : hard reset of the DTC
** FF temp      : prints the DTC firefly temperatures
** Launch Run   : launch emulated CFO run plan once
** ROC pattrn   : obsolete, replaced by InitReadout
** InitReadout  : initializes the DTC for a given readout mode               
- the DTC readout mode is defined by the CFO mode and the ROC readout mode
- DTC may be run in a so-called 'CFO emulation mode', in which no external CFO
  is needed 
** EmulateCFO   : set to one if the DTC is running in a CFO emulation mode
** ROC r/o mode :                                                            
  - 0: ROC emulated patterns
  - 1: digis
  - 2: (not implemented yet) do we need more , i.e. digi patterns ?
** ROC tabs     : each DTC panel has 6 ROC tabs                              
*** status     : print ROC status
*** write      : write ROC register
*** read       : read  ROC register
*** reset      : reset the ROC (write 1 to register 14)
** Start Read   : start readout thread                                       
- doesn't perform any initializations, only readout 
- it is assumed that the readout has been initialized - InitReadout called
- 'PrintFreq' defines how often the thread is printing its statistics
** Start emuCFO : start emulated CFO thread                                  
- [[file:../otsdaq-mu2e-tracker/Gui/DtcGui_threads.cc::/DtcGui::EmuCfoThread/]]
- executes a given run plan in an emulated CFO mode in a loop
- a run plan is defined by 'NEvents', 'EW length', 'First TS', 'SleepUS'
* general panel                                                              
** clear   : clear the outptu window
** exit    : exit
** NEvents : N(events) per run in the CFO emulation mode
** EWLength : event window length in units of 25 ns
- EWLength=80 defines an event window length of 2000 ns
** FirstTS  : first event window tag in a run for teh CFO emulation mode
** SleepUS  : sleep time, in us, after a single run has been taken
in a CFO emulation mode
